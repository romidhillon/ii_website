// process of django 

// django server running --> the client/user makes a request to see a page by clicking a button 
// Django creates a HttpRequest object that contains metadata about the users request
// the page navigates to the url -----> django searches for the url in the application 
// the url is found in the urls.py file ---> a view is associated with that url 
// django then goes to the view ----> the users request object HttpRequest is the first argument to the view function.
